Real-Time Chat Application using C++
# Real-Time Chat Application (C++) :

## Project Overview :

This is a **real-time chat application** developed using **C++ socket programming**.
It allows multiple clients to communicate with a server in real time through a terminal-based interface.

---

##  Features :

* Client–Server communication using TCP sockets
* Username-based chat system
* Timestamp added to each message
* Real-time message broadcasting
* Basic error handling for client/server failures

---

##  Technologies Used :

* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts:** Socket Programming, TCP/IP, File Handling
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub

---

##  How It Works :

1. Server starts and listens on a specific port
2. Clients connect to the server using IP address and port
3. Each client enters a username
4. Messages sent by one client are received by all connected clients
5. Each message is displayed with username and timestamp

---

## How to Run the Project :

### Compile :

```bash
g++ server.cpp -o server
g++ client.cpp -o client
```

### Run Server :

```bash
./server
```

### Run Client :

```bash
./client
```

##  Learning Outcomes :

* Understood real-time communication concepts
* Learned TCP socket programming in C++
* Improved error handling and debugging skills
* Gained experience using Git & GitHub
